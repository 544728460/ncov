# About  

This repository analyzes viral genomes using [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) to understand how SARS-CoV-2 is evolves and spreads.

We maintain a number of publicly-available builds, visible at [nextstrain.org/ncov](https://nextstrain.org/ncov).

* **Setup and installation**  
* **Orientation: analysis workflow**  
* **Orientation: which files should I touch?**  
* **Running & troubleshooting**   
* **Customizing your analysis**  
* **Customizing your visualization**
* **Options for visualizing and sharing results** (including working with sensitive metadata)

### Download formatted datasets  

The hCoV-19 / SARS-CoV-2 genomes were generously shared via GISAID. We gratefully acknowledge the Authors, Originating and Submitting laboratories of the genetic sequence and metadata made available through GISAID on which this research is based.

In order to download the GISAID data to run the analysis yourself, please see [this guide](XXX).  
> Please note that `input_data/metadata.tsv` is no longer included as part of this repo. However, we provide continually-updated, pre-formatted metadata & fasta files for download through GISAID.

### Read previous Situation Reports  
We issued weekly Situation Reports for the first ~5 months of the pandemic. You can find the Reports and their translations [here](https://nextstrain.org/ncov-sit-reps).

### FAQs  

- Can't find your sequences in Nextstrain? Check [here](./docs/data_faq.md) for common reasons why your sequences may not be appearing.
- For information about how clades are defined, and the currently named clades, please see [here](./contributor_docs/clades.md).
