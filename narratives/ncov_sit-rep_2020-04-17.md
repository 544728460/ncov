abstract: "This weekly report uses publicly shared genomic data to track the spread of COVID-19. This week, we focus on the outbreak in the United States. For most areas of the U.S., we find evidence for multiple introductions -- of both international and domestic origins. This data emphasizes that the decisions made by each state profoundly impacts the fate of the others."

# Executive summary

We analyzed 1,347 publicly shared hCoV-19 genomes from the United States. By comparing these viral genomes to each other, we can characterize how hCoV-19 is moving around the world and spreading locally. In this week's updates, report:  

* The New York outbreak is cosmopolitan, but the majority of cases are attributable to introductions from Europe.   
* The outbreak in New York City shows mixing of cases across all 5 boroughs.  
* The outbreak in California is related to both nearby Washington State and distant New York.  
* The Midwest outbreak is heterogeneous, and is the result of many independent introductions.
* Ongoing outbreaks in Utah and Idaho are closely related.
* The decisions made by each state profoundly impacts the fate of the others. "Liberating" any state safely will require coordinated containment, with all states acting to protect each other.

# [A note on sampling](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america/2020-04-17?c=division&d=map&f_country=USA&p=full&r=division)
We currently have sequences from samples collected in 36 states. This is an incredible achievement -- sequencing an unknown, large RNA virus in the midst of a pandemic is difficult, and is only possible through the incredible work and timely sharing of data by scientists and physicians around the world.
<br><br>
While this data enables us to infer many useful characteristics of the outbreak and track its spread in real time, it's important to emphasize that our conclusions are limited by the available data.
<br><br>
For example, the map shows relatively few sequences from the Southeastern United States. This is NOT because COVID-19 isn't circulating in these areas, or that these cases are not as crucial to understand; rather, we just don't have much data available from these areas. The size of each circle on the map indicates how much data is currently available from that area, rather than the true size of the outbreak.

# [Main New York clade linked to European outbreak](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america/2020-04-17?c=division&d=tree,map&f_division=Europe,New%20York&label=clade:A2&p=full&r=division)

As you may have seen [in the news this week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html), most of the viral samples from New York (in color) group closely with samples from Europe (gray).
<br><br>
The New York clade is both flanked by and intercalated with sequences from Europe, which strongly suggests that most early cases resulted from introductions from Europe.

# [Many introductions to New York](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america/2020-04-17?label=clade:A2&c=division&d=tree,map&f_division=Europe,New%20York,Asia&p=grid&r=division)

Although the majority of the New York outbreak was seeded by European introductions, by adding in more contextual sequences, we get a more nuanced view.
True to its cosmopolitan nature, there are also cases in New York that are closely related to samples from every other region of the world.
<br><br>
Notably, although the early New York cases were most likely represent inbound transmission, the directionality of these transmissions is less clear later on in the outbreak. As we reported on [last week](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-04-10?n=11), there is also evidence for recent reintroductions from the U.S. to Europe and Asia.

# [Intermingling of cases from all 5 NYC boroughs](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america/2020-04-17?c=location&d=tree,map&f_division=New%20York&f_location=Bronx,Brooklyn,Queens,Staten%20Island,Manhattan&label=clade:A2&p=full&r=location)

Within New York City, we see little segregation of cases by borough. This is consistent with frequent mixing of cases across the city.

# [California outbreak related to both nearby and distant states'](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america/2020-04-17?c=division&f_division=California,New%20York,Washington&r=location&d=tree,map)

We also see evidence of multiple introductions between states. For example, cases from California span the genetic diversity of the tree, grouping together with samples from both nearby Washington State and New York. This is evidence for transmission between California and both nearby and distant states.

# [Midwest outbreaks were seeded by many introductions](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america/2020-04-17?c=division&d=tree,map&f_country=USA&f_division=Illinois,Indiana,Iowa,Kansas,Michigan,Minnesota,Nebraska,Ohio,Wisconsin&p=full&r=division)

Turning our attention to the Midwestern United States, we see that cases from this area are spread evenly across the tree, rather than forming a series of tight clusters. This tells us that there have been many independent introductions to these states, with several different transmission chains circulating in parallel.

# [Related outbreaks across the Rocky Mountain West](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america/2020-04-17?c=division&d=tree,map&f_country=USA&f_division=Idaho,Utah&label=clade:A2&m=div&p=full&r=division)

There have also been several introductions to the Rocky Mountain West. Zooming in, we see a well-resolved transmission chain making its way across Idaho. Notably, this set of cases is flanked by a cluster of cases from Utah, demonstrating a close relationship between these two outbreaks.

# [What you can do](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/north-america/2020-03-27?c=country&d=map&p=full)
#### ...as an individual
* Practice strict social distancing, especially if you are in a vulnerable group.
* Remember that even if you are not super vulnerable, many people around you are; follow these practices to protect others.
* Wash your hands "like you just chopped a jalapeno and have to change a contact lens."  
* Stay home as much as possible -- especially  if you are sick; be prepared with extra supplies in case you need to self-quarantine.  
* If you are an employer, encourage your employees to work from home wherever possible.

#### ...as an official  
* Make testing free and broadly available.  
* Put strong social distancing measures in place.  
* Fund and implement extensive contact tracing efforts.  
* Financially support those impacted by social distancing measures.

# Takeaways

* Introductions from Europe seeded the majority of the New York outbreak, but there were also cosmopolitan introductions from other areas of the world.
<br><br>
* As the outbreak has progressed, we also see evidence for re-introductions from the U.S. to Europe and Asia.
<br><br>
* The outbreak in New York City shows mixing of cases across all 5 boroughs.
<br><br>
* The outbreak in California is related to both nearby Washington State and distant New York.
<br><br>
* The Midwest outbreak is also heterogeneous, with multiple transmission chains circulating in the region.
<br><br>
* Outbreaks in Utah and Idaho are closely related, with ongoing community transmission.
<br><br>
* The decisions made by each state profoundly impacts the fate of the others. "Liberating" any state safely will require coordinated containment, with all states acting to protect each other.
