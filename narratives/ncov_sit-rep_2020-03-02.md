## Executive summary

Using 146</tag> publicly shared COVID-19 genomes, we examined genetic diversity to characterize the spread of COVID-19 in different areas and infer date of common ancestor.
We find:
* Genetic sequence data supports the hypothesis of undetected, sustained spread of COVID-19 in the greater Seattle area since mid-January ([show me](link)). TODO
* COVID-19 was introduced into Italy at least twice with subsequent community spread. ([show me](link)). TODO
* All the sequenced cases included in this analysis likely share a common ancestor sometime between mid November and mid December 2019. ([show me](link)). TODO
* Using estimates of total case count from Imperial College London of several thousand cases, we infer a reproductive number between 1.8 and 3.5 indicating rapid growth in the November 2019-Janurary 2020 period. ([show me](link)). TODO

## FAQs & Conspiracy Theories

### FAQs

We know that a lot of people have questions about COVID-19. 
We've set up a guide to try and answer some of those most frequently asked [here]() TODO.


### Conspiracy Theories

A number of false ideas have been circulated about the origins of the novel coronavirus.
During outbreaks like this one, the spread of information that's known to be incorrect can lead to more panic, and cause people not to trust scientists and governments, meaning they are likely to follow advisories and take appropriate precautions.

In an effort to try and explain why these views are incorrect, we have 'debunked' these theories at the pages below:

# [Phylogenetic analysis](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-03?m=div&d=tree)

Here we present a phylogeny of 151</tag> strains of nCoV that have been publicly shared.
Information on how the analysis was performed is available [in this GitHub repository](github.com/nextstrain/ncov).

<br>

The colours represent the within-country region or US-state of isolation, with the x-axis representing nucleotide divergence.

<br>

Divergence is measured as the number of changes (mutations) in the genome.
Several sequences have zero mutations -- meaning they are all identical to the root (center) of the tree.
Other viruses have between one and seven mutations.

<br>

Sequencing the genome of a large novel RNA virus in an evolving outbreak situation is challenging.
Some of the differences observed in these sequences may be sequencing errors rather than actual mutations.
Insertions, deletions, and differences at the ends of the genome are more likely to be errors and so we masked these for the purposes of this analysis.

# [Phylogenetic Interpretation](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-03?m=div&d=tree)

We currently have sequenced cases from five different continents.
While the early cases where all directly linked to cases in Wuhan, associated with the seafood market outbreak, we now observe various different cases that show evidence for community spread or were imported from sources outside China.

<br>

Generally, repeated introductions from an animal reservoir will show significant diversity (this has been true for Lassa, Ebola, MERS-CoV and avian flu).
The observation of such strong clustering of human infections can be explained by an outbreak that descends from a single zoonotic introduction event into the human population followed by human-to-human epidemic spread.

<br>

# [At least two introductions with community spread into Italy](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-02-03?m=div&d=tree)

We currently have 3 sequences from Italy, two of which from the Rome area and one from Lombardy in northern Italy.
These 3 sequences share a common ancestor early in the epidemic, which strongly suggests that there were at least two introductions with community spread into Italy.

<br>

The two sequences from the Rome are cluster together and therefore indicate local spread.
The sequence from Lombardy (Italy/CDG1/2020) clusters together with sequences with known travel history to Italy that were most likely infected in Italy.

<br>

# [Export of COVID-19 from Italy to other countries in Europe and Brazil](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-02-03?m=div&d=tree)

There are several cases of COVID-19 with known travel history to Lombardy.


<br>

We can observe these patterns in the phylogenetic tree.
Brazil/SPBR-01/2020 and Finland/FIN-25/2020 for example have a known travel history to Italy and cluster together with a sequence from Lombardy, Italy/CDG1/2020.

<br>

# [Likely spread of SARS-Cov 2 in the Seattle area](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-02-03?m=div&d=tree)

There are now several cases of COVID-19 reported in the greater Seattle area and the US in general.
The newly isolated and sequenced case from Snohomish County (north of Seattle), is genetically closely related to a case isolated at the end of January in the same area.

<br>

There are two explanations to why this is the case.
Either, the virus was introduced at least twice into the greater Seattle area from a common source in China.
The far more likely explanation, however, is that the virus was circulating undetected in the area for a while.

<br>



# [Dating the time of the most recent common ancestor](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-03?d=tree)

The time of the most recent common ancestor (or tMRCA) of a set of sequenced cases denotes when these sequenced cases last shared a common ancestor.
This time can be as early as the time when a virus first entered the human population, but can also be substantially later as show in the figure below.

<div>
  <img alt="Example phylogeny where the time of the initial zoonosis is different from the most recent common ancestor of several sequenced cases" width="500" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicfel/nCov-Nicola/master/figures/zoonosis.png"/>
</div>



```auspiceMainDisplayMarkdown
## Date of the common ancestor of outbreak viruses

Several research groups and people have estimated the time of the most recent common ancestor.
http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-129-genomes-24-feb-2020/356
http://virological.org/t/evolutionary-epidemiological-analysis-of-93-genomes/405/2

The common ancestor of all sequences is most likely between mid November and mid December.
This would be consistent with all currently sequenced cases descending from the [initial cluster of cases at the Wuhan seafood market](http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-129-genomes-24-feb-2020/356).

<div>
  <img alt="graph of TMRCA estimates based on different mutation rates" width="500" src="https://data.nextstrain.org/ncov_poisson-tmrca.png"/>
</div>

Using the entire data set, the nextstrain analysis pipeline estimates that the common ancestor most likely existed between late-Nov and the beginning of December 2019.

There is a [confirmed case in Wuhan with onset date of December 1, 2019](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1220749265380593664), which would put an upper bound on the date of most recent common ancestor.
The common ancestor of viruses sequenced to date might be later than this date though.

More detailed modeling of the onset of the outbreak are ongoing.
Despite considerable uncertainty, our best guess is remains late November/early December 2019.

# [Estimating the growth rate](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-03?d=tree)

An important quantity in the spread of a pathogen is the average number of secondary cases each infection produces.

<br>

This number is known as R0 ("R-zero" or "R-nought").
One the right, we present simple estimates of R0.

```auspiceMainDisplayMarkdown
## Estimates of epidemic growth rate
Scientists at Imperial College London have used the number of cases observed outside of China to estimate the [total number of cases](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/) and suggested that there have been at least several thousand cases by 2020-01-22.
With the additional exported cases since and the continued growth of confirmed cases in China, we currently have to expect at least 50000 cases to date.
Together with our previous estimates of the age of the outbreak and information on the infectious period, we can estimate plausible ranges of R0 using a branching process model.

**We find plausible estimates of R0 between 1.8 and 3.5.**

If we assume the outbreak started at the beginning of November 2019 (12 weeks ago), we find that R0 should range between 1.8 and 2.5, depending on how large ('n') the outbreak is now.
<div>
  <img alt="graph of R0 estimates with epidemic start 12 weeks ago" width="500" src="https://data.nextstrain.org/ncov_branching-R0-early_2020-01-29.png"/>
</div>

If we assume a more recent start, at the beginning of December 2019 (8 weeks ago), the estimates for R0 range between 2.2 and 3.5:
<div>
  <img alt="graph of R0 estimates with epidemic start 8 weeks ago" width="500" src="https://data.nextstrain.org/ncov_branching-R0-recent_2020-01-29.png"/>
</div>
This estimates are broadly consistent with those by other scientists which mostly fall between R0=2-3, see for example <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.919787v1">this preprint</a>.
Importantly, R0 is a quantity that depends strongly on the socio-economic context and infection control measures.
